Project 5-Public API Request


This project is a web app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the US. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

A request is sent to The Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) and the returned JSON object is parsed for data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking on the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
